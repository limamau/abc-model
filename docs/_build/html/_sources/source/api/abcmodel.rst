ABC Model
=========

The model's components are supposed to be documented in a structured way.
In each model page, we can see two main classes: ``InitConds`` and ``Model``.

``InitConds`` is a data class containing all the variables that make part of the ``state`` of the model
(and thereby of the ``CoupledState``) and will be updated by the model during ``run`` (diagnostics)
or ``integrate`` (prognostics, if any).

The ``Model`` class contains parameters, the ``run`` method and sometimes an ``integrate`` method.
Inside ``run``, variables ``x``, ``y``, etc, are updated using methods ``compute_x``, ``compute_y``, etc; and these
methods are documented in the order that they are called. The goal is that a reader can essentially read the
equations of each variable computation as they are done by our models and learn how things work from that.

Somemtimes, the ``state`` is updated inside a more complicated method like ``update_something``. This is sometimes
used for the modularity of our models (models within abstract models).
