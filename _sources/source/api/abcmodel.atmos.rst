Atmosphere
==========

For now, we only have a model simulating the evolution of the atmos during daytime

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    abcmodel.atmos.dayonly

which uses three components

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    abcmodel.atmos.surface_layer
    abcmodel.atmos.mixed_layer
    abcmodel.atmos.clouds

as implementation of the abstracts

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    abcmodel.atmos.abstracts
